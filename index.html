					<p>I am currently exploring various aspects of IT. Software Development and Digital Design (UI and UX design) are two areas that fit my qualities well. In addition, Information & Cyber ​​Security appeals to me a lot, because I like to take on a lot of responsibility. I like excitement and challenge, which is why I would like to try this direction.</p>

					<p>I have gained experience with various programming languages, such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. JavaScript is my favorite so far and that is where my focus is at the moment. I am now learning to work with Canvas, so that I can create a virtual world with self-driving cars during my next project. The focus here is on neural networks, among other things, and with this I learn to understand Artificial Intelligence. I want to build this project with React and then I want to delve into Node.js.</p>

					<p> By practicing with IT aspects that appeal to me, I hope to gradually find my niche. This way I can do what I like most and where my qualities are best used. Because I am good at coming up with creative solutions, I find coding and especially tracking and fixing bugs addictively fun.</p>

					<p>In my spare time I enjoy graphic design, drawing and other creative activities such as DIY projects. In addition, I like to spend time in nature to recharge and gain new inspiration. Do you want to know more about me personally?</p>

				<!-- Portfolio -->
				<article id="portfolio">
					<h3 class="major">Portfolio</h3>
					<p>"Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find a collection of projects and assignments that I have made.<p>

					<h4>Web Development Course</h4>
					<div id="certificate">
					<img src="images/certificate.jpg" alt="certificate Web Development">
					<p>I started with a Web Development course at Wink Academy, which made me discover how much fun coding is. I learned to work with JavaScript in the console and made <a id="text-link" href="https://replit.com/@RobinvanKempen/HTML-and-CSS-datingwebsite-Cupida-Robin-van-Kempen">my first project</a>. The assignment was to design a dating website with HTML and CSS.</p>
					</div>

					<h4>Score System</h4>
					<p> After that I was given the assignment to create a system for motocross trainers. With a lot of enthusiasm, patience and YouTube tutorials I created and styled a program "from scratch" that is actually in use. I am quite proud of this. During the creation of this I mainly learned Object Oriented PHP and mySQL, so the program is linked to a database. The goal is that trainers of motocross riders can assess their students more fairly. Previously they did this in an Excel file, but now they can do this in my program that is linked to <a id="text-link" href="https://mx-education.com/">their website</a>. It is in a secure environment, so unfortunately I can not show it live, but I can in a screen recording video. The code is mainly OOP PHP and MySQL and therefore comparable to that of <a id="text-link" href="#cv">my cv</a> and I am not posting it on GitHub. But of course, if you would really love to see it you can <a id="text-link" href="#contact">send me a message</a>.

					<h4>App</h4>
					<p>I also developed an app for someone else, but it is no longer online because the makers of the app development tool stopped working on it. Nevertheless, I can show some <a id="text-link" href="">screenshots</a> to show what it looked like. The app was for a store (coincidentally for motorsports again) and customers used it to order products and call and navigate to the company. They mainly used it for the online stamp card with which they could save discounts for products.</p>

					<h4>Snake Game</h4>
					<p>I also worked with someone for a while who taught me a lot about hosting, SEO, Wordpress and FileZilla. However, I didn't like no-code and low-code as much as working with programming languages, so I mainly focus on that now. I like to practice with FreeCodeCamp, Codeacademy, Coursea and my favorite: YoutTube tutorials. For example, I used it to create this <a id="text-link" href="">snake game</a>.</p>

					<h4>Canvas</h4>
					<p>I am currently working on canvas in JavaScript, so that I can use it to create a project in which I learn about how Artificial Intelligence works with neural networks, among other things. I will create that project with React and then I will delve into Node.js.</p>

					<h4 id="cv">Resume</h4>
					<p>If you haven't seen it yet, here is <a id="text-link" href="#">my resume</a>. This was a fun exercise to review PHP and mySQL. It is hosted for free on <a id="text-link" href="https://www.infinityfree.com/">InfinityFree.com</a> so that it can be viewed online from any device and adjusted by me.</p>

					<h3 class="major">About me</h3>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/me-and-my-dogs.jpg" alt="Photo of me and my dogs" /></span>
					<p>Hi! I'm Robin and I live in the beautiful Groesbeek in the Netherlands with my boyfriend Roland and our dogs Boño and Theo. I often walk with them in places where you can admire nature, such as in the woods or on the beach. In spring and summer I inventory butterflies and bumblebees as a volunteer for the <a id="text-link" href="https://www.vlinderstichting.nl/english/">Dutch Butterfly Conservation</a>.</p>

					<p>When I'm not at home behind my laptop, I'm usually doing something creative or working on my garden or houseplants. Unless my dogs are entertaining me, because they're very good at that. In the evening Roland and I usually enjoy a horror movie or games in virtual reality. Do you want to know what I actually do behind my laptop? </p>
